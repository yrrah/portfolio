  desc: Exploration of NLP models applied to congressional legislation. The project required deciding how to break up and tokenize large documents of structured, but not consistently annotated text. I produced an RDF graph representation of each document along with vector representations of document paragraphs to perform similarity searches. I plan to revist this project in light of the recent developments with GPT LLMs.
